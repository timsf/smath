==========

This is a collection of LaTeX macros that automates and centralizes most of the formatting in math mode. Instead, you declare a variable to belong to some class of mathematical objects (i.e. a vector) and the package defines the appropriate formatting for that class. The overall goal is to let you focus on the meaning of your writing, just as outside of math mode.
