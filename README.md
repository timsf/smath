smath
==========

smath is a collection of LaTeX macros that automates and centralizes most of the formatting in math mode. The package defines appropriate formatting for different mathematical objects which can be easily applied to any string. The overall goal is to let you focus on the meaning of your writing, just as outside of math mode.
